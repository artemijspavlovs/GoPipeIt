# gopipeit

`gopipeit` aims to provide a seamless CI/CD setup for your Go project (with plans to support other languages and frameworks in the future). It achieves this by generating configuration files for [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint), [goreleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser), [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) with sensible defaults, as well as CI pipeline configuration files for GitHub Actions (with support for other platforms planned for future releases).
